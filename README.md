# aksh.dev — My Digital Fireplan 💥

Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This portfolio is built to be more than just a resume — it’s a curated **ops-log** of who I am, what I believe in, and how I lead.

Whether you're here to see my work, review my experience, or just admire a well-placed neon accent, you're in the right place.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

This site is handcrafted using:

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) — component-based, fast, and flexible
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) — safety nets are great when moving fast
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) — because writing CSS from scratch is a form of punishment under milirary law /s
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) — for secure, simple backend & auth
- Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) — because I like things being easy

## 🔥 Philosophy

> “No plan survives contact with the enemy, but a good one gives you options.”

## 🧠 Core Values

These aren’t just buzzwords — they guide every project I touch:

  Ship the right thing, for the right reason, at the right time.

  Leadership means listening, supporting, and knowing when to get out of the way.

- 🧭 **Strategic Clarity**  
  Decisions rooted in purpose, communicated as soon as possible.
